- reevaluate decisions made about passing by pointers vs. value 
    - consider when pointer to type vs. when type itself implements interfaces
- make sure all naming conventions are followed
- get rid of unnecessary decimals passed into floats when the numbers are ints for consistency
- maybe modify value method of texture interface to pass in pointers to floats for uv
